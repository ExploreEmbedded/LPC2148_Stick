 * File:   main.c
 * Version: 16.0
 * Author: ExploreEmbedded
 * Website: http://www.exploreembedded.com/wiki
 * Description: This file contains the program to read & write date&time from internal RTC
 *              Date and time is set only once in the beginning after that it is continously read and Displayed on LCD

This code has been developed and tested on ExploreEmbedded boards.  
We strongly believe that the library works on any of development boards for respective controllers. 
Check this link http://www.exploreembedded.com/wiki for awesome tutorials on 8051,PIC,AVR,ARM,Robotics,RTOS,IOT.
ExploreEmbedded invests substantial time and effort developing open source HW and SW tools, to support consider 
buying the ExploreEmbedded boards.
